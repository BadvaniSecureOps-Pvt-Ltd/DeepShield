**Mobile-First Deepfake Detection** | SIH 2025 Project

##  About the Project

DeepShield helps users **detect deepfakes and fake content** by analyzing uploaded **images/videos** using AI/ML models.
The solution is:

* ** Mobile-first** → Works on Android/iOS using Flutter.
* ** Lightweight** → FastAPI backend optimized for hackathon deployment.
* ** Reliable** → Provides detection + explainability with confidence score.
* ** Secure** → Supports API key authentication and minimal data collection.

---

##  Problem Statement

> With the rise of manipulated media, misinformation spreads quickly. Detecting deepfakes in a user-friendly way is critical for digital trust.

DeepShield addresses this by offering a **simple mobile app** + **scalable backend** that can be used by individuals, journalists, or institutions.

---

##  Architecture

```
[ Mobile App (Flutter) ] ⇆ [ Backend API (FastAPI) ] ⇆ [ ML Model (PyTorch/TensorFlow) ]
```

* **App (Flutter):** Capture/Upload → Send to backend → Show result.
* **Backend (FastAPI):** Handle requests → Run inference → Return JSON.
* **Model:** Detect deepfakes → Return label + confidence + explanation.

##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BadvaniSecureOps-Pvt-Ltd/DeepShield.git
cd DeepShield
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend runs at:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 3. Setup Mobile App

```bash
cd app/deepfake_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 👩‍💻 Git Workflow

We follow a **branch-based workflow**:

* `main` → Stable, production-ready code.
* `backend-api` → Backend development branch.
* `flutter-app` → Flutter app development branch.

### Common Git Commands

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/BadvaniSecureOps-Pvt-Ltd/DeepShield.git

# Switch branch
git checkout flutter-app   # or backend-api

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin flutter-app

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added upload API integration"

# Push changes
git push origin flutter-app
```

##  Demo Flow (Hackathon Thin-Slice)

1. User uploads **image/video**.
2. App compresses & sends file → backend.
3. Backend runs model → returns JSON.
4. App shows result: ✅ *Real* / ❌ *Deepfake* with confidence %.

---

##  Impact & Benefits

* **Misinformation Control** → Stops fake media early.
* **Accessibility** → Works on mobile, no heavy infra needed.
* **Scalable** → Extendable for government/media use.
